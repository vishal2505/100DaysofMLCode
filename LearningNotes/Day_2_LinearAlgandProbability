Probability -
=============

The Probability for getting k successes in n Bernoulli trails is given by:

P(X=k) = nCk pk qn-k  ,  [here p is the probability of success and q is the probability of failure]

Area Under the Normal Distribution
====================================


The distance in terms of number of standard deviations, the observed value is away from the mean, is the standard score or the Z score.

A positive Z score indicates that the observed value is Z standard deviations above the mean. 
Negative Z score indicates that the value is below the mean.


Observed value = µ+zσ 
                [µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation]
                
                
Challenge 1: Try calculating the probability of getting 50 heads and 50 tails on 100 flips of fair coins? 
              This expectation is known as the gambler’s fallacy!

Solution - 
             ncr * P(Success)^50 * P(fail)^50, n=100, r=50
            =100c50 * (.5)^100
            where 100c50=100891344545564193334812497256
            =0.07958924


Challenge 2: In the United States, the average IQ is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. 
              What percentage of the population would you expect to have an IQ more than 120?
              
Solution -
            Z score= (120-100)/15 =1.33
            Use the z table and z=1.33 corresponds to 0.9082 which is the area under the curvefrom -infinity to 120. 
            but we need people with iq greater than 120 , so 1-0.9082= 0.0918 ==> 9.18%
