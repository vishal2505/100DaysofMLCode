Probability -
=============

The Probability for getting k successes in n Bernoulli trails is given by:

P(X=k) = nCk pk qn-k  ,  [here p is the probability of success and q is the probability of failure]

Area Under the Normal Distribution
====================================


The distance in terms of number of standard deviations, the observed value is away from the mean, is the standard score or the Z score.

A positive Z score indicates that the observed value is Z standard deviations above the mean. Negative Z score indicates that the value is below the mean.


Observed value = µ+zσ [µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation]
